The main goal of this project was to build a CV generator using React. The CV generator consists of two main sections: the control and the visualization sections. In the control section, the user can input, edit and delete their information. The information inputted in the control section will be available in real-time in the visualization section. When finished, the user can then download their CV properly formatted in PDF. This project was made using React JS.

 What I learned
While doing this project, I learned:

React Fundamentals
Creating a react app with Create React App
Learned other better ways for this as well, like through Vite or Next.js
But decided to go ahead with CRA since The Odin Project recommended CRA when I started the project for learning purposes
It probably is still fine for learning
Class components and lifecycle methods
Function components and Hooks
Migrating from class components to function components
and replacing lifecycle methods with equivalent hooks like useEffect
Controlling inputs and rendering lists in react
Managing state in react
Using external libraries like Zustand, react-pdf & dndkit
Zustand for global state management
react-pdf for pdf generation
dndkit for sortable drag 'n' drop lists
Deploying a site with a PaaS like Cloudflare Pages.
